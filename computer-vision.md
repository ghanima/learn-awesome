## Research Papers

- [An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning](http://ai.stanford.edu/%7Eacoates/papers/coatesleeng_aistats_2011.pdf) - Interesting paper about how using weaker classifiers (kmeans) can get comparable results to more sophisticated ones like deep neural nets with the decisions made before training a model like statistical whitening, picking a large number of features, etc.
- [Viola jones robust real-time object detection](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/mzucker1/papers/violaJones_IJCV.pdf) - Real time face detection method most cameras use today, discusses ensemble learning methods (adaboost) and a clever way to detect features in one O(n) pre-processing step.
- [Example-based photometric stereo: shape reconstruction with general, varying brdfs](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/sam/HertzmannSeitzPAMI2005.pdf) - Discusses how you can reconstruct an objects 3d shape just by analyzing how light reflects off an object's surface.
